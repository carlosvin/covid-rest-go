This is a port of a [REST API written in Java using Spring Boot to expose COVID data](https://github.com/carlosvin/covid-rest), this version is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) using [GinGonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic).

The main goal of this port written in [Go](https://golang.org/)+[GinGonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic) is to compare it with [Java](https://java.com)+[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) stack for creating REST services.
